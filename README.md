# belly-button-challenge

In this challenge we are analysing given data : https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json

Steps for the code is as follows: 
1. Using D3 library to read the sample json.
2. Creating three types of charts to display data:
    - Horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs
    - Bubble chart that displays each sample
    - Gauge Chart to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual
3. Next the code is modified to display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information
4. For the final step, we update the dropdown so to select the sample id that we want to look at.
